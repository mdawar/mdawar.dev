Styling links that open in a new tab is a nice thing to add, this way the reader will know that a link will open in a new browser tab.

You can target these links using the CSS attribute selector:

```css {lineNumbers: true}{copy: true}
a[target="_blank"] {
  /* Add your external link styles */
}
```

You can also use the `::after` pseudo-element to add an arrow, for example:

```css {lineNumbers: true}{copy: true}
a[target="_blank"]::after {
  content: "â†—";
}
```
