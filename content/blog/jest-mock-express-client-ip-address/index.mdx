When working on an **Express** application that deals with the remote client IP address you might need to mock this IP address in your unit tests, this article shows how you can do this using **Jest**.

### Example Express.js application

Creating an example project:

```bash {terminal: true}{copy: true}
# Create a new directory and cd into it
mkdir express-app
cd express-app
# Create a package.json file
npm init -y
# Install express
npm i express
```

This is an example **Express** application that returns a JSON object containing the client's IP address using `req.ip`.

```js {title: src/app.js}{copy: true}
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Just return the client's IP address as JSON
app.get('/', (req, res) => res.json({ ip: req.ip }));

module.exports.app = app;
```

---

**Note**: By default, if the `trust proxy` application variable is set to `false` (default), then the IP is derived from `req.connection.remoteAddress` otherwise it will be taken from the `X-Forwarded-For` header depending on your configuration.

See: [Express behind proxies](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/behind-proxies.html) for more details.

---

And this is the module that starts the application on port `3000`:

```js {title: src/server.js}{copy: true}
const { app } = require('./app');
const port = 3000;

app.listen(port, () =>
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`)
);
```

Now you can start the application:

```bash {terminal: true}{promptLines: 1}
node src/server.js
Example app listening at http://localhost:3000
```

And try it out:

```bash {terminal: true}{promptLines: 1}
curl localhost:3000
{"ip":"::1"}
```

### Mocking the `req.ip` property

To test this application we're going to use `jest` and `supertest`.

First install them as dev dependencies:

```bash {terminal: true}{copy: true}
npm i -D jest supertest
```

This is an example test file that shows how to mock `req.ip` using `jest.spyOn`:

```js {title: tests/app.test.js}{copy: true}
const request = require('supertest');
const req = require('express/lib/request');
const { app } = require('../src/app');

const CLIENT_IP = '1.2.3.4';

beforeEach(() => {
  // Mock the `ip` property on the `req` object
  jest.spyOn(req, 'ip', 'get').mockReturnValue(CLIENT_IP);
});

afterEach(() => {
  // Restore all the mocks back to their original value
  // Only works when the mock was created with `jest.spyOn`
  jest.restoreAllMocks();
});

test('Client IP', async () => {
  const response = await request(app).get('/');

  expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200);
  expect(response.type).toBe('application/json');
  expect(response.body.ip).toEqual(CLIENT_IP);
});
```

We are passing a third argument `get` to `jest.spyOn` because `req.ip` is a getter function, check out the [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/jest-object#jestspyonobject-methodname-accesstype) for more details.
