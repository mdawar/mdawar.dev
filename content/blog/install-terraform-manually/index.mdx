Installing Terraform is very easy, it's available as a single binary named `terraform`.

### 1. Download the zip archive

Go to the [Terraform Downloads](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) page and download the appropriate package for your system.

```bash {terminal: true}
# Example downloading the 64-bit Linux zip archive
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.26/terraform_0.12.26_linux_amd64.zip
```

### 2. Unzip the package

```bash {terminal: true}{promptLines: 1,2}
# Unzip the downloaded archive
unzip terraform_0.12.26_linux_amd64.zip
Archive:  terraform_0.12.26_linux_amd64.zip
  inflating: terraform
```

If you don't have `unzip` installed, then you can install it for example on Debian based systems:

```bash {terminal: true}{copy: true}
sudo apt-get install unzip
```

### 3. Move the binary to a location available in your `PATH`

View the list of locations in your `PATH`:

```bash {terminal: true}{promptLines: 1,2}
# The locations are separated by colons (:)
echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
```

Move the `terraform` binary to one of the listed locations:

```bash {terminal: true}
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/terraform
```

### 4. Verify the installation

```bash {terminal: true}{promptLines: 1,2}
# You should be able to run terraform from any location
terraform version
Terraform v0.12.26
```

### 5. Enable tab completion (Optional)

You can enable tab completion if you're using `bash` or `zsh`.

```bash {terminal: true}{copy: true}
terraform -install-autocomplete
```

Then you can use the `Tab` key to autocomplete Terraform commands.
